# Today's Holidays

This project is the front end companion to the [Today's Holidays API](https://github.com/Ttesori/api-todaysholiday) to serve up offbeat/funny holidays for a particular month or day.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, JSX, HTML, CSS

The application was created to reacquaint myself with the fundamentals of React, especially with the recent introduction of hooks. It is also designed using a mobile-first methodology, which is the first time I utilized that during a project. In addition, it heavily utilizes SVG graphics, which create big impact with small file sizes.

## Lessons Learned:

- Mobile-first designing is way easier than trying to shoehorn it in after creating a desktop version.
- I love the organization and speed of React. It greatly appeals to my information architecture/librarian side!
- Be cognizant of background images when creating designs. The wave combined with the angled gradient made implementing this background a bit challenging in practice -- something to keep in mind for the future.
